# The Sunrise Formula: Your Path to a Perfect Morning  

## üìå Project Description  

**The Sunrise Formula** is an interactive web project that captures the **unfiltered morning routine** of a university student. Inspired by the structured aesthetic of **Wes Anderson‚Äôs filmmaking**, the project aims to create a visually engaging and immersive experience.  

At the heart of this project is an exploration of **idealized vs. real** morning routines. Many students begin their semester with ambitious goals‚Äîwaking up early, eating a healthy breakfast, and following a structured routine. However, as academic stress builds, these habits often change. This project documents a **real-life morning routine** through a mix of **videos, animations, and interactive elements**, allowing users to engage with the content rather than passively observe.  

The experience is designed to be **engaging, informative, and interactive**, providing insights into **three core morning habits‚Äîsleep, hydration, and exercise**‚Äîwhile allowing users to explore different aspects of the routine at their own pace.

## üîß Process: Implementing the Concept  

### **Planning & Content Creation**  
The initial planning phase focused on identifying key elements that make up a **morning routine** and translating them into **aesthetic visuals**. The decision to film in a **Wes Anderson-inspired style** was made to add a structured, cinematic quality to the project. Filming followed a **story-driven approach**, capturing the small but meaningful aspects of a typical morning at NYU Abu Dhabi.  

To enhance **user engagement**, interactivity was integrated through **JavaScript-driven elements** that allow visitors to control how they experience the content. The website layout was designed to be **clean, immersive, and easy to navigate**, with a soft, warm color palette to reflect the comforting yet structured nature of mornings.  

### **Interactivity & User Engagement**  
This project is more than just a **passive viewing experience**‚Äîusers can actively explore Asini‚Äôs morning routine through various **interactive components**, including:  

- **Number-based Routine Navigation:**  
  Users are invited to **enter a number (1-7)** into an input box, triggering dynamic text updates that reveal different stages of Asini‚Äôs morning routine. This allows users to **progress through the experience in a nonlinear way**, choosing their own path rather than following a strict sequence.  

- **Enhancement Decision (YES/NO Interaction):**  
  A key feature of the project is the interactive decision-making section, where users are asked:  
  **"Do you want to enhance Asini‚Äôs morning routine?"**  
  Clicking "YES" turns the button into a üòä emoji and smoothly scrolls the page to the **morning routine improvement section**, where users can learn how to optimize their mornings. Clicking "NO" changes the button into a üò¢ emoji and scrolls the page back to the **beginning of the website**, reinforcing the theme of **choices shaping our routines**.  

- **Emoji-Based User Feedback:**  
  At the end of the experience, users can react to the content using **emoji buttons (üòä, üòê, üò¢)**. Their choice triggers a corresponding **response message**, adding a fun, interactive layer to the feedback process.  

- **Smooth Navigation & Usability Enhancements:**  
  To improve the user experience, several **functional enhancements** were included:  
  - A **floating "Back to Top" button**, allowing users to instantly return to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling effect.  
  - A **scroll progress bar** at the top of the screen, visually indicating how much of the website has been explored.  
  - Aesthetic **curved text elements** that display "Starring" and "Shot By" labels in a visually appealing way.  

### **Multimedia & Aesthetic Choices**  
The project incorporates **embedded videos** to illustrate different elements of a morning routine. Three short **looping videos** play automatically to emphasize the importance of:  
1. **Getting enough sleep**  
2. **Hydrating in the morning**  
3. **Starting the day with exercise**  

The videos are presented in a structured **grid layout**, ensuring that the content remains visually balanced and easy to follow. Additionally, the project credits are displayed as an **image gallery**, linking to the contributors' LinkedIn profiles, adding a layer of professionalism and authenticity.

## üé≠ Reflection & Evaluation  

### **Successes & Achievements**  
This project successfully **transformed a simple morning routine into an engaging, interactive experience**. By blending **storytelling, cinematography, and interactivity**, it creates a narrative that is both relatable and aesthetically pleasing. The **interactive features** enhance engagement, making the audience feel **involved in the routine rather than just observing it**.  

The **aesthetic consistency**, from the **soft pastel color scheme** to the **precise, structured visual elements**, stayed true to the initial **Wes Anderson-inspired vision**. The **smooth animations, video integration, and interactive decision-making elements** made the project **engaging and immersive**.  

### **Challenges & Learnings**  
Since this was my first time using HTML and CSS, one of the biggest challenges was deciding on a cohesive color scheme and making sure all elements matched aesthetically. At first, I struggled to find the right balance between a visually engaging design and maintaining readability. Experimenting with different background colors, text styles, and spacing helped me refine the look, but it was a time-consuming process.

Another challenge was figuring out how to make the project interactive. Initially, this was meant to be a simple storytelling website, but I wanted it to feel more immersive. I spent time brainstorming ways to engage the user, which led to features like the number-based morning routine navigation, YES/NO buttons, and emoji feedback system. Thinking through how users would interact with the content helped shape the final structure of the project.

I also faced difficulties in adjusting the sizes of different containers throughout the website. Ensuring that everything looked consistent and well-aligned required a lot of manual and iterative modifications‚ÄîI had to keep tweaking widths, margins, and padding until everything felt balanced. Small changes often had unintended effects on spacing, which meant constantly revisiting and refining the layout.

Despite these challenges, the learning process was extremely rewarding. By the end of the project, I felt much more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I gained a better understanding of how to structure, style, and enhance web pages with interactivity.

### Were My Expectations & Goals Met?  

Going into this project, my main goal was to **create an engaging, visually appealing, and interactive way to showcase a morning routine**. I wanted the website to feel **aesthetic yet functional**, ensuring that users didn‚Äôt just passively view the content but actively participated in the experience.  

Looking at the final version, I believe my **expectations were met, and in some areas, even exceeded**. The project successfully captured the **essence of a morning routine** through **storytelling and structured cinematography** while introducing **multiple interactive elements** that made the experience both **engaging and immersive**. Despite initial struggles with **color selection and layout consistency**, the final design resulted in a **visually cohesive and aesthetically pleasing** website. The interactive features, such as **number inputs, feedback buttons, and navigation choices**, played a crucial role in enhancing user participation.  

While there are areas I‚Äôd like to improve‚Äîsuch as **making the interactivity even more dynamic and adding more personalized elements**‚Äîthe final result **closely aligns with my original vision**. The process of **learning, iterating, and problem-solving** made this an incredibly valuable experience, and I‚Äôm proud of how the project turned out.

### **Potential Improvements**  
While the project successfully achieved its core objectives, there are several ways it could be enhanced further:  
- **Personalized Routine Generator:** Users could answer a few questions to receive a **customized morning routine** based on their preferences.  
- **Expanded Number-Based Storyline:** Instead of only 7 stages, the number input could allow users to explore different **"what-if" scenarios**‚Äîshowing how slight changes in the morning routine could impact the rest of the day.  
- **Additional Animations & Sound Design:** Incorporating subtle **background animations** or **ambient morning sounds** (like birds chirping or coffee brewing) could **enhance immersion**.  
- **More Data-Driven Insights:** Providing statistics on **how morning habits impact productivity, stress, and focus** would add an **educational component**.
